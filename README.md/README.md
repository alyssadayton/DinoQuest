#Homeschooling app 
##Synopsis
This is a homeschooling app designed to help homeschooling parents to keep up with all the craziness that comes with it.
##Motivation
I homeschool my two oldest boys and the oldest is in 1st grade so they have less than older children do. I have a hard time trying to keep up with everything along with remembering what they did during the week. We have to submit a paragraph of what each child did during the last week. This will help keep all of it in there.
##How to run
You simply follow the prompts, it asks if you would like to enter a new student or log into a student already created. It then prompts you to choose between notes, current assignment, future assignment.
